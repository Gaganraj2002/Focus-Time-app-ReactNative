# Focus-Time App

Focus-Time is a React Native application that helps you stay productive by focusing on tasks for set intervals of time. You can enter a task name and choose from three different time options: 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. The app allows you to start, pause, and resume the timer. Once the time is up, it vibrates and returns to the home screen, where you can see the tasks you've focused on.
